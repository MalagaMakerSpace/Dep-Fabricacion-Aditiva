# Summary

Adapter bracket to install a MKS Gen L or BIQU BIGTREETECH SKR with original 50mm fan into the CR-10 case. Mounts using existing screws from the melzi board, 50mm fan will require 20mm m3's. Board mounted on adapter with m3 6mm computer screws.

**Please note:** You will lose SD card support with the MKS using the original screen. Alternative is to purchase a [reprap screen](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller) or use the SKR instead with onboard SD using the [cutout template](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3371042) courtesy of [P_C_R](https://www.thingiverse.com/P_C_R)

Template to cut the hole for USB port included, place on outside and mark the hole with a scribe or place tape underneath and mark with a pen. I drilled a pilot hole and used a [nibbler tool](https://www.amazon.com/RadioShack-RadioShack%C2%AE-HT-204-Nibbling-Tool/dp/B007Z7PY48) to make it rectangular and a file to finish it off and touched up the exposed metal with some black touch-up paint.
